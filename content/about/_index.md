Hi! I'm a jazz trumpet player freelancing around the GTA and I'm a senior software engineer at Pivotal. I discovered web development while most people still thought Perl was cool and music long before that. I play with a number of groups around Toronto including the self titled "Jesse Malone Quintet". I also regularly play with Robin Jessome's Blunt Object, the Writers' Jazz Orchestra, the Greater Toronto Philharmonic Orchestra, the regimental band of The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada and you might spot me in a mariachi band from time to time.
