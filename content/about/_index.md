Hi! I'm a jazz trumpet player freelancing around the GTA and I'm a Software Engineer at Pivotal. I discovered web devlopment back when Perl was cool and music long before that. I play with a number of groups around Toronto including the  Jesse Malone Quintet and Malone/Felman Duo. I also regularly play with Robin Jessome's Blunt Object, the Writers' Jazz Orchestra.
