### The Jesse Malone Quintet

The Jesse Malone Quintet began as and continues to serve as my outlet for composition. The group plays almost exclusively original compositions. In this endeaver I sometimes try to bridge the gap between my two disparate interests, writing tunes inspired by, or at least named for, concepts from computing.  

The group regularly features:

Jesse Malone	 - 	Trumpet/Flugelhorn  
Ben Dietschi	 - 	Tenor Saxophone  
Matt Newton	 - 	Piano  
Mark Godfrey	 - 	Bass  
Norbert Botos	 - 	Drums

### Feldman / Malone Duo

Pianist [Jon Feldman](https://jonfeldman.bandcamp.com/) and I have spent a long time jamming together exploring our favourite standards. That has turned into this duo project where we're often joined by friends and fellow musicians turning our duo into a trio or quartet.
