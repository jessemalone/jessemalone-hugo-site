### The Jesse Malone Quintet

The Jesse Malone Quintet began as and continues to serves as my outlet for composition. The group plays almost exclusively original compositions. In this endeaver I sometimes try to bridge the gap between my two disparate interests, writing tunes inspired by, or at least named for, concepts from computing.  

The group regularly features:

Jesse Malone	 - 	Trumpet/Flugelhorn  
Ben Dietschi	 - 	Tenor Saxophone  
Matt Newton	 - 	Piano  
Mark Godfrey	 - 	Bass  
Norbert Botos	 - 	Drums
