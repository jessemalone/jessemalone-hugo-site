<p>The Jesse Malone Quintet began as and continues to serve as my outlet for composition. The group plays almost exclusively original compositions. In this endeaver I sometimes try to bridge the gap between my two disparate interests, writing tunes inspired by, or at least named for, concepts from computing.</p>
<p>The group regularly features:</p>
<p>Jesse Malone	 - 	Trumpet/Flugelhorn<br>
Ben Dietschi	 - 	Tenor Saxophone<br>
Matt Newton	 - 	Piano<br>
Mark Godfrey	 - 	Bass<br>
Norbert Botos	 - 	Drums</p>

<h3 id="feldman--malone-duo">Feldman / Malone Duo</h3>
<p>Pianist <a href="https://jonfeldman.bandcamp.com/">Jon Feldman</a> and I have spent a long time jamming together exploring our favourite standards. That has turned into this duo project where we&rsquo;re often joined by friends and fellow musicians making a trio or quartet.</p>
