                <p><p>Hi! I&rsquo;m a jazz trumpet player freelancing around the GTA and I&rsquo;m a Software Engineer at Pivotal. I discovered web devlopment back when Perl was cool and music long before that. I play with a number of groups around Toronto including the self titled &ldquo;Jesse Malone Quintet&rdquo;. I also regularly play with Robin Jessome&rsquo;s Blunt Object, the Writers&rsquo; Jazz Orchestra, and you might spot me in a mariachi band from time to time.</p>
